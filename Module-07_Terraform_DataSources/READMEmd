# Terraform Datasources
  Data sources allow Terraform to use information defined outside of Terraform, defined by another separate Terraform configuration, or modified by functions.

## Section-7.1: Terraform Data sources Overview

## Section-7.2: Terraform Data sources Syntax
   A data source is accessed via a special kind of resource known as a data resource, declared using a data block:

   `data "data_source_type" "data_source_label" {`
        `most_recent = true`
        `owners = ["self"]`
        `tags = {`
            `Name   = "app-server"`
            `Tested = "true"`
        `}`
    `}`

## Section-7.3: Examples
